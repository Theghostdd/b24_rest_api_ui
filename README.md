# UI Application for Integration with Cloud Bitrix24

This UI application is designed for integration with **Cloud Bitrix24** and utilizes the **Bitrix24 API** library to work with the **Rest API methods** of Bitrix24. It is developed to facilitate user interaction with the platform by providing powerful tools for data manipulation and request creation.

## Key Features:

- **Use of jsonpath Library:** The application uses the **jsonpath** library to extract necessary keys from JSON responses, significantly simplifying data handling.

- **Brief Documentation:** The application includes clear and accessible documentation on how to work with **jsonpath**, helping users efficiently extract the required data from JSON responses.

- **Request Sandbox:** The application provides an interactive "sandbox" where users can write and test API requests, configure parameters, and instantly see responses from Bitrix24.
